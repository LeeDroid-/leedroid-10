* Did you backup your previous install?
* A Nandroid backup is always recommended!

Required:

* An unlocked boot-loader
* A custom recovery (TWRP Recommended)
* The latest HTC build release firmware
(This will insure maximum stability)

*ONLY SELECT THE AROMA OPTIONS YOU UNERSTAND

*If you have opted to wipe and do a fresh install, 
please ensure you used the option to Format Encryption / Data 
in TWRP prior to installing, Legacy wipe options will not work!

Thanks
